    		<p>
            	I'm a second year masters student at UC Davis in Computer Science currently looking for full time opportunities
	    	in Software Engineering starting Summer 2020. I am interested in developing high scale software. I have 2 years of 
		automation experience under my belt wherein I worked primarily in Perl and Python. 
        	</p>
        	<p>
           	Recently I have been working on <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize">Amazon's Alexa Prize Competition</a> for 
		which our team at UC Davis has been selected in the top 10 teams in the world to compete for the third edition of the 
		competition for the 2019-2020 academic year. I believe that I am a person who likes to work/play in teams. In my free time, 
		I like to play soccer, swim, travel and of course, code!
